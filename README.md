# **Intro to LangChain Workshop: Enhancing LLM Applications with Advanced Workflows**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Mastering LangChain** workshop! In this session, you'll learn how to utilize the powerful capabilities of LangChain to create, manage, and deploy advanced workflows for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. The workshop will guide you through everything from basic setup to advanced use cases, including multi-agent systems, document retrieval, and connecting to external APIs.

By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to:

- Set up your environment to work with LangChain.
- Build and chain language models for complex workflows.
- Use agents to interact with APIs and external tools.
- Develop a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
- Understand best practices for deploying LangChain in production environments.

## **Prerequisites**

Before starting the workshop, please ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+** (We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.)
- Basic knowledge of Python and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## **Agenda**

1. **Introduction to LangChain**: Overview of features and use cases.
2. **Setting Up the Environment**: How to set up a Python environment to work with LangChain.
3. **Basic Components of LangChain**: Understanding Chains, Agents, and Memory.
4. **Advanced Workflows**: Combining multiple tools and APIs for complex workflows.
5. **Connecting to External APIs**: Building agents that interact with external APIs.
6. **Building a RAG System**: Retriever-Augmented Generation for document question answering.
7. **Deploying LangChain in Production**: Best practices for deploying LangChain in distributed systems.
